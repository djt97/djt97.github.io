It was not at all clear back when ChatGPT-3 was the frontier model that LLMs were going to have utility beyond writing emails or editing essays. Nowadays, ChatGPT Pro is a fully-fledged research assistant, only better. The benchmarks are already unbelievable: just last month, the DeepSeekMath-V2 model scored 118/120 on the 2024 Putnam competition. For context, this is higher than the highest score of the 90 human participants <d-cite key="deepseek2025math"></d-cite>.</p> <p>Benchmarks are one thing, but actual research is another. If the numbers don’t convince you, perhaps a Fields Medalist will. <a href="https://mathstodon.xyz/@tao/115306424727150237" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Terence Tao recently described</a> how he used ChatGPT Pro to flesh out a counterexample to a conjecture. Back in August, mathematician Sebastien Bubeck <a href="https://x.com/SebastienBubeck/status/1958198661139009862" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">shared how he solved</a> an open convex optimization problem using ChatGPT Pro. And the improvements keep coming: according to Daniel Litt, ChatGPT 5.2 Pro (released last week) represents a <a href="https://x.com/littmath/status/2000636724574302478" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">“step change” in usefulness</a> for algebraic geometry and number theory.</p> <p>If leading mathematicians are outsourcing some thinking to an LLM, what does this mean for the future of research?<d-footnote>Tao has been somewhat prescient on this. Back in 2023 he <a href="https://unlocked.microsoft.com/ai-anthology/terence-tao/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">wrote</a>: "I expect, say, 2026-level AI... will be a trustworthy co-author in mathematical research." See also his recent paper on mathematical discovery at scale <d-cite key="tao2025exploration"></d-cite>.</d-footnote></p> <hr> <h2 id="from-proof-writers-to-proof-checkers">From Proof-Writers to Proof-Checkers</h2> <p>In my own research ChatGPT Pro has been invaluable, but using it effectively has required a change in my workflow. For example, in my recent paper <a href="/projects/controlling_complex_contagions">Controlling Complex Contagions</a> I was stuck on a particular proof which I gave to the model. As I stepped through its working, I noticed a mistake. I pointed out the mistake and it tried again. Five times we went through this loop until finally, I could find no more errors. The proof was correct.</p> <p>Essentially, my role shifted from being a <em>writer</em>, to being a <em>checker</em>. This represents a huge productivity boost, but proof-writing and proof-checking are different skills. Good proof-writing requires technical skills and creativity. Proof-checking, on the other hand, requires attention to detail, patience, and skepticism. They’re complementary skills, but they are different. There is also a risk that the shift is not benign: early evidence suggests that fully outsourcing the creative work to AI can weaken understanding. <d-footnote>Heavy GenAI use correlates with lower exam scores <d-cite key="wecks2024generative"></d-cite> and diminished creative writing ability <d-cite key="niloy2024menace"></d-cite>. More concerning, "passive" use---accepting AI output without making any changes---has been linked to lower essay quality <d-cite key="yang2024modifying"></d-cite> and weaker brain connectivity during tasks <d-cite key="kosmyna2025brain"></d-cite>. One concern I have is that if researchers shift entirely to checking, they risk becoming like students who attend the lectures but never complete the homework. While no one accuses researchers of "cheating" for (e.g.) using Google, the generative act of proof-writing may be essential for deep understanding in a way that search is not. It is a tension worth monitoring.</d-footnote></p> <p>Of course, in a world where researchers are proof-checkers rather than proof-writers, the ability to write technically challenging proofs becomes less valuable. An important question then is: which skills become <em>more</em> valuable? To answer that, we need some Economics. But first, I want to propose a thought experiment.</p> <hr> <h2 id="the-proof-machine">The Proof Machine</h2> <p>Imagine you alone had access to a machine which could immediately tell you the answer to <strong>any</strong> math problem you asked of it. You can ask as many questions as you like (this is not a “no wishing for more wishes” situation). What would you ask? “Solve the Riemann hypothesis”? “Does P=NP”?</p> <p>I imagine once you’ve exhausted all the remaining <a href="https://www.claymath.org/millennium-problems" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Millennium Prize problems</a> and moved through the <a href="https://www.erdosproblems.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Erdös problems</a>, you might find yourself… <strong>bored</strong>. Why? Because when solving problems becomes easy, the binding constraint (there’s the economics) is no longer <em>compute</em>, it’s asking the right <em>questions</em>.<d-footnote>This is essentially the "Prediction vs. Judgment" trade-off described by Agrawal, Gans, and Goldfarb in <i>Prediction Machines</i> <d-cite key="agrawal2018prediction"></d-cite>. As AI drives the cost of "prediction" (solving the proof) to zero, the value of the complement, "judgment" (asking the question), rises.</d-footnote></p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/proof-machine-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/proof-machine-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/proof-machine-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/proof-machine.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" alt="Illustration of the Proof Machine concept" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> <p>Asking the right questions has always been an important skill in research, but I think in the past one could mask a lack of vision with technical virtuosity (no, I’m not going to name names). In a world where solving problems is easy, the best researchers will be those who can formulate the most interesting, important, and novel questions.</p> <p>It is worth noting that while this “Proof Machine” is still a hypothetical for frontier mathematicians like Tao, for the rest of us—economists, quantitative social scientists, engineers, and even many physicists—the machine is effectively already here. That makes what I am about to say even more pressing.<d-footnote>In applied fields, we rarely need to invent new mathematical machinery; we apply existing machinery to new models. The tools we use have already been effectively mastered by current reasoning models, which is why I claim the machine is "already here". Of course, LLMs still hallucinate and make errors; the point is that, for many problems, solving is no longer the main bottleneck.</d-footnote></p> <hr> <h2 id="the-renaissance-of-intuition">The Renaissance of Intuition</h2> <p>In many ways, this dynamic isn’t new. Senior professors have often operated as “visionaries,” coming up with the “good questions” and handing off technical grunt-work to graduate students. But the “Proof Machine” accelerates this pipeline by orders of magnitude. For professors with teams of RAs at their disposal, the essential skill remains asking the right questions. But for graduate students doing the work, the essential skill becomes efficient verification.</p> <p>This brings us to what I think is the most important skill of the AI era: Intuition.</p> <p>Terence Tao has spoken about the <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/theres-more-to-mathematics-than-rigour-and-proofs/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">“post-rigorous” stage of mathematical development</a>, where deep intuition guides you to the answer before you write the proof. He suggests that you develop this intuition by <em>doing</em> the rigorous grunt-work. The danger now is that if our students leave all the rigour up to AI, they might never develop the intuition required to efficiently check its working. The key for the next generation will be to use AI aggressively <em>after</em> they’ve built some intuition, not instead of it.</p> <p>But for those who do have a good intuition, AI is a superpower. It allows us to skip over the minutiae and focus entirely on the <em>structure</em> of the argument—as someone who doesn’t like having to work through the details, this is my absolute dream come true. In this world, the best researchers will be the ones with the best “gut sense” of the truth. They are the ones who can look at a machine-generated proof and say, “That is technically correct, but it misses the point,” or “That result feels wrong, check the assumptions.”</p> <p>The machine can drive the car, and it can steer around the potholes. But it lacks an internal compass. It doesn’t know when we’ve wandered into the wrong part of town, or if the destination is even worth visiting. That sense of direction remains, for now, a deeply human problem.</p> <hr> <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <p>We are entering a golden age of research productivity, but it demands a retooling of our relationship with our work. If you treat AI as a substitute for your thinking, you will become a passive observer of machine-generated logic.</p> <p>But if you treat it as a complement, you can shift your focus higher up the value chain. The researchers who thrive will be those who cultivate the patience to verify the machine’s work, and the taste to know which questions are worth asking in the first place.</p> <p>The “Proof Machine” is here. Do you have the questions to keep it busy?</p> <p>DJ</p> </d-article> <d-appendix> <d-footnote-list></d-footnote-list> <d-citation-list></d-citation-list> </d-appendix> <d-bibliography src="/assets/bibliography/proof-checkers.bib"></d-bibliography> <div id="giscus_thread" style="max-width: 930px; margin: 0 auto;"> <script>let giscusTheme=determineComputedTheme(),giscusAttributes={src:"https://giscus.app/client.js","data-repo":"djt97/djt97.github.io","data-repo-id":"R_kgDOLjeNUA","data-category":"Comments","data-category-id":"","data-mapping":"title","data-strict":"1","data-reactions-enabled":"1","data-emit-metadata":"0","data-input-position":"bottom","data-theme":giscusTheme,"data-lang":"en",crossorigin:"anonymous",async:""},giscusScript=document.createElement("script");Object.entries(giscusAttributes).forEach(([t,e])=>giscusScript.setAttribute(t,e)),document.getElementById("giscus_thread").appendChild(giscusScript);</script> <noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://giscus.app/?ref_noscript" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">comments powered by giscus.</a> </noscript> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2025 DJ Thornton.
