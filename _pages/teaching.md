This term (Sep-Nov) I'm teaching ECON2112: Game Theory and Business Strategy. You can find the course outline [here](https://www.unsw.edu.au/course-outlines/course-outline#year=2024&term=Term%203&deliveryMode=In%20Person&deliveryFormat=Standard&teachingPeriod=T3&deliveryLocation=Kensington&courseCode=ECON2112&activityGroupId=1).

We follow the excellent textbook [Game Theory for Applied Economists](https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691003955/game-theory-for-applied-economists) by Robert Gibbons. If you've already bought the book and are looking for a backup digital copy, I have found that it never hurts to do a quick Google search for the pdf. For a gentler and much briefer introduction to the subject, chapters 12-13 of Banerjee's [Intermediate Microeconomics](https://banerjeemicro.com/) are very good.

If you have any questions about the course (as a student or otherwise), please feel free to reach out!
