I am a PhD candidate at the University of New South Wales. My advisors are [Richard Holden](https://richardholden.org/) and [Gabriele Gratton](https://gratton.org/). I study microeconomic theory applied to networks ([diffusion](projects/strategic_diffusion), [externalities](projects/bad_networks)) and learning ([feedback loops](projects/learning_feedback)). I'm also interested in culture and narratives.

I completed my undergraduate degrees in Pure Math (with Honours) and Commerce. My 2019 honours thesis was on the theory of the giant component and information cascades in random graphs.

I was the youngest lecturer for the faculty of Economics at UNSW in 2020 when I began lecturing at age 23. I have an extensive teaching record and have lectured 12 courses and tutored 18 courses since 2018, spanning economic theory, economic history, applied microeconomics, and econometrics.

Outside of academia, I love music, philosophy, coffee, and most importantly spending time with my family. My wife and I also run a [paediatric occupational therapy clinic](https://www.bloom-ps.com.au/). You can find some photos of my wonderful family [here.](projects/family_photos)
