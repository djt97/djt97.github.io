My paper [Bad Networks]({% link _projects/bad_networks.md %}) with [Richard Holden](https://richardholden.org/) and [Robby Akerlof](https://robertakerlof.com/) is being revised for the Journal of Public Economics.

This is particularly exciting for me as it is actually my first R&R! We've already made substantial progress towards addressing the comments of the editor and referees, you can expect a new version of the paper before Christmas.
