Yesterday I presented my paper [Learning with feedback loops]({% link _projects/learning_feedback.md %}) at the [Econometric Society Australasian Meeting](https://esam2024.org/). The paper has been substantially updated over the last few months and I anticipate it will be ready to circulate in the new year, but in the meantime if you're interested you can see my updated presentation slides [here](/assets/pdf/LWFL_DJ_Dec24).

The conference has been absolutely excellent, with talks from the likes of [Larry Samuelson](https://sites.google.com/site/larryatyale/), [Ben Golub](https://bengolub.net/), [Olivier Bochet](https://sites.google.com/site/obochet2/), [Eduard TalamÃ s](https://www.eduardtalamas.com/) and many other invited speakers (not to mention the contributed sessions!)

I want to make special mention of Eduard's paper [Artificial Intelligence in the Knowledge Economy](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/bqez6vlhd82t3c9gr7ies/Ide-Talamas.pdf?rlkey=c5qxx2ps444b1ddv25pvsww5q&e=1&st=ie1rbtmu&dl=0) with [Enrique Ide](https://www.enriqueide.com/) which is just beautiful and has been a standout for me at this conference. If you're interested in the effects of AI on the labor market and you haven't read this paper, go and check it outâ€” you won't be disappointed!
